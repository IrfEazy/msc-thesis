       "       ' Some Background Info\\n\\nI have two hardrives that I use for archiving my data They are formatted to ext4 and are clones of eachother The way that I archive my data is I write the data to the one drive and then I just clone it to the second Ive been doing this for a number of years Recently however when I went to add more data to the archive I did a comparison of the data on each drive with rsync and apparently lots of data had small differences even though it should be a perfect clone I did some reading and found that hard drives decay at approximately 1 per year This makes sense given the amount of bit changes that have occured in my drives To help minimize bitrot I heard that you are supposedly supposed to refresh the data on the drives every now and then there are a few methods for this ie just writing the data back to the drive dd ifdevsda ofdevsda etc however if a bit change has occured this will do nothing to fix that \\n\\n Enter ZFS\\n\\nI have read that it is a good idea to use ZFS for archival storage since it implements checksums in the data This is all well and good but I am unsure exactly how to protect the data with such checksums I have never used ZFS before If I understand correctly the checksums are added to the data when it is written to the ZFS drive and then they are employed to check the data when data is read from the ZFS drive If so these checks could be done when the drive is refreshed however I dont think that the aformentioned trick with dd ifdevsda ofdevsda would work for this as it isnt necessarily reading from the ZFS filesystem but instead just writing raw data to the drive Perhaps a better method would be to use a buffer drive to write data to and then write it back Is there perhaps a better method to do this Or am I looking at ZFS all wrong',\n",

attributes of real estate property \\n   1 ie Address Last Sold Value Taxes Owners Assessed Value etc Some attributes are lists ie sold transfer date related to sold transfer value  there are generally multiple rows here\\n3 There are more than 1 grouping of data sets that require specialized functions for retrieval of data ie county 1 requires different code to acquire data than county 2 or county 3\\n4 I want to save the data to a local disk so data retrievalanalysis does not have to happen again Only when I run update functions to update data sets which will be done manually\\n5 Retrieving data will be for data analysis For instance Ill want to plot all home prices sold per sqft within the last 5 years against timedate etc \\n\\nFurther Down the Road\\n\\nFurther down the

retrieval of data Would it be more efficient to just write individual functions for retrieving the data rather than setting up a whole class structure\\n2 Am I right in assuming that I can just collpase the lists down to a string through the JSON module for storing each data set if I go the SQLite DB route Upon data analysis I can just unscramble it with JSON again into a list\\n3 Whats your opinion on the best method to choose with all that is know ie Im leaning towards straight up SQLite without alchemy or peewee due to the assumption of the following\\n   1 I can get each set doesnt matter which county down to a single row using the JSON compaction technique\\n   2 SQLite has sufficient means of efficiently filtering through data for data analysis For instance  I dont have to pull every variable any time I go to compare certain columns sets attributes etc Im not super familiar with this as I havent learned SQL yet\\n\\nx200B\\n\\nI know this is a long post but Im very

       "       'Ive recently rebuilt my home server that Ive used as a NAS and media center for years  Due to some other concerns Ive got a reason now to learn about how docker containers work kubernetes deployments and a few other things so Ive taken the opportunity to do more with my home server in a journey of personal enrichment or pain take your pick  To that end Im looking to see if there is a better way to do a few things that Ive been having trouble finding alternatives for myself\\n\\nx200B\\n\\n1 My usual method of interacting with the server is using KiTTY and putty in the past from my main PC Windows to ssh over and doing everything that way  Recently found and tried WeTTY but thats essentially the same thing just via a browser tab  However in looking up guides and information recently I saw a person using VS Code and doing some amazing things like having a file explorer style window having a seperate window pop up when editting files instead of doing everything in a single terminal session and a few other cool things\\n\\nI did download and install VS Code to try and see if it was easy to implement that sort of functionality myself but that was several hours of wasted effort and not worth it  Just wondering if there is a more efficient tool than a simple ssh terminal window out there that isnt also a full blown IDE or complicated enterprise management tool\\n\\nx200B\\n\\n2 While Ive used docker containers in the past its literally just been a couple that were super easy to setup and run with no effort  Now Ive been learning docker compose and have a file of about 15 containers  Im planning to split those up into a few separate projects like the core static NAS stuff I need stuff to play with and edit regularly others Ive solidified but arent super critical to restore if something goes wrong etc  So I went looking for a tool to make that all easier to edit run and manage beyond just simply throwing them in separate folders with their own compose files  To that I end I tried yacht and portainer\\n\\nPortainer was terrible  It to require you to do way too much that I dont need to maintain all the functionality it provides  It has several options unavailable in its UI to advertise its paid functionality that I dont need or care to see the notices about  And it added stuff to my docker deployments that I didnt know nor care to figure out why it was doing that\\n\\nYacht was much better but the dashboard regularly just didnt work although usually a page refresh fixed it  The variable feature didnt work with the dockercompose like feature thus Id need to redo my entire setup as Ive got an env file for a lot of repeatable entries  And it was quite laggy in accessing the individual container status pages log files and other nice features that make it worth using over just doing everything manually  Also one of the dockers I installed via portainer then deleted and tried to recreate in Yacht would also have all the extra options added by portainer included when I created the container from scratch which made no sense and I couldnt figure out why that was happening\\n\\nHonestly something like Yacht but less latency in the UI and the variable system working would be perfect  Is there something like that out there  Really just want a nice frontend for management multiple dockercompose files and seeing the status of running containers\\n\\nx200B\\n\\n3 My form of version control and tracking is keeping my files on an SMB share loading it up with Notepad on my Windows PC and enabling the feature to have it automatically create a backup and track lines which have changed  Which to be honest is working perfectly fine for me and Im not really looking for more  However now that Im doing more with my server I thought itd be worthwhile to try selfhosting something like gitea and learning a bit about version control and management through git\\n\\nHowever when I deployed the gitea container I had a couple of issues that just instantly put me off  One I left the defaults which had the local root URL set to localhost and I was connecting to it initially from my Windows PC and it flashed up a huge error message when I did that and there was no obvious explanation of why that was necessary  Im sure I could figure it out if I dug hard enough but the very reason for that being a thing was confusing and nonsensical to me  And it also required you to setup user accounts\\n\\nConsidering this is a little self hosted setup for just me I dont need to deal with another user management system if I wanted to deal with that Id just sign up for a github account and play with that  Is there something out there with checking out or should I just go through github',\n",
